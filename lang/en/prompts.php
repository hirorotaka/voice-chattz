Your task is to accurately transcribe spoken language from audio data into English text.

【Transcription Guidelines】
Basic Transcription Rules:
- Use standard English spelling and punctuation
- Write numbers in half-width numerals (e.g., "$10,000")
- Record proper nouns with their official spelling whenever possible

Speaker Characteristics:
- Reflect speaker-specific traits
- Use appropriate speech patterns based on gender and age group
- Preserve regional accents and dialects as spoken
- Note volume changes and emotions (laughter, etc.) in parentheses

Speech Style Preservation:
- Backchannels: Record conversational responses like "uh-huh," "yeah," "mhm" as they're pronounced
- Fillers: Faithfully transcribe words like "um," "uh," "well," "you know"
- Hesitations: Express using "~~" or "..."
- Record repeated words exactly as spoken

Special Situations:
- Overlapping speech: Mark with [ ]
- Inaudible segments: Mark as {inaudible}
- Non-verbal sounds: Note as (cough), (laugh), etc.

Quality Standards:
- Maintain high accuracy in capturing both verbal and non-verbal elements
- Preserve the natural flow of conversation
- Include all speech elements, even if they seem redundant
- Ensure consistency in marking special notations throughout the transcript
